# Pando Configuration
#
# This file configures pando's behavior for managing git worktrees.
# See https://github.com/zpyoung/pando for documentation.

# Rsync Configuration
# Controls how files are copied from source tree to new worktrees
[rsync]

# Symlink Configuration
# Controls which files are symlinked instead of copied
# Patterns support glob syntax (e.g., "*.json", ".env*")
[symlink]

relative = true

# Worktree Configuration
# Controls default behavior for worktree operations
# defaultPath - Default parent directory for new worktrees
#   Relative paths resolve from git root, branch names are auto-appended
#   Example: "../worktrees" with --branch feat/login → ../worktrees/feat_login
# rebaseOnAdd - Automatically rebase existing branches onto source when adding worktree
#   Set to false to disable automatic rebase, or use --no-rebase flag
# deleteBranchOnRemove - Delete branch when removing worktree
#   none: Do not delete branches (default)
#   local: Delete local branch only
#   remote: Delete both local and remote branches
